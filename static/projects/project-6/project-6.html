    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Situation:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The Spaceship Titanic dataset, sourced from Kaggle, required preprocessing and the development of a classification model. The dataset contained missing values, both in numeric and categorical features, and was intended for training a machine learning model to predict a target variable, possibly related to the transportation status of individuals on the spaceship.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Task:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Data Processing:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Handle missing values in both numeric and categorical features.</li>
        <li>Interpolate missing values in numeric features using linear interpolation.</li>
        <li>Fill missing values in categorical features with the most frequent category.</li>
        <li>Split the dataset into training and testing sets.</li>
    </ul>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Classification Script:</strong></p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Define transformers for categorical and numeric features using Pipelines.</li>
        <li>Combine transformers using a ColumnTransformer.</li>
        <li>Create a classification pipeline that includes data preprocessing and a RandomForestClassifier.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Action:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">To address the challenges posed by the dataset, a series of Python scripts were created. The data_processing handles missing values, performed linear interpolation for numeric features, and filled categorical features with the most frequent category. Additionally, the data was split into training and testing sets. In parallel, the classification script defined transformers for both categorical and numeric features using Pipelines and a ColumnTransformer. The classification pipeline included preprocessing steps and utilized a RandomForestClassifier, though it was noted that this classifier could be replaced with an alternative based on the project's requirements.</p>

    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Result:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">The scripts successfully processed the Spaceship Titanic dataset, addressing missing values and preparing the data for classification. The RandomForestClassifier was chosen as a default classifier, providing a baseline for further model exploration. The resulting scripts serve as a foundation for building and testing machine learning models on this dataset.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;">Model Performance Improvement:</p>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>The initial accuracy of the model was 73%, and through iterative experimentation and fine-tuning, the model's accuracy was improved to 78%. This improvement signifies the effectiveness of the preprocessing steps and opens avenues for further enhancement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Skills and Technologies Implemented:</h3>
    <ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
        <li>Python Programming</li>
        <li>Pandas for Data Manipulation</li>
        <li>NumPy for Numerical Computations</li>
        <li>Scikit-Learn for Machine Learning</li>
        <li>RandomForestClassifier</li>
        <li>Pipelines and ColumnTransformer</li>
        <li>Data Preprocessing Techniques</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 style="color: #333; font-size: 20px; margin-top: 15px;">Reflection:</h3>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Challenges:</strong> Dealing with missing values in both numeric and categorical features required thoughtful handling. Choosing appropriate preprocessing steps, such as linear interpolation for numeric features and filling categorical features with the most frequent category, was crucial for maintaining data integrity.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Flexibility:</strong> The use of Pipelines and ColumnTransformer in the classification script enhances the code's flexibility. By encapsulating data processing steps and classifier selection, the scripts can be easily adapted for future iterations or different datasets.</p>
    <p style="margin-left: 20px;"><strong>Further Steps:</strong> The RandomForestClassifier was chosen as a default classifier; however, further exploration with alternative classifiers, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering could be considered to improve model performance.</p>
